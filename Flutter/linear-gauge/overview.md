## Key Features

* **Orientation** - The Linear Gauge can be set to vertical or horizontal orientation.
* **Axis** - The Linear Gauge axis is a scale where a set of values can be plotted. An axis can be customized by changing the thickness and edge styles. You can also inverse the axis.
* **Labels and Ticks** - The Linear Gauge axis elements, such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks, can be customized to different styles.
* **Ranges** - A range is a visual element that helps you quickly visualize where a range falls on the axis track. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to a linear gauge.
* **Pointers** - A pointer is used to indicate a specific value on an axis. The widget has three types of pointers: shape marker pointer, widget marker pointer, and bar pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed. You can add multiple pointers in a linear gauge.
* **Mirror Gauge** - The linear gauge can be mirrored.  When the mirror property is true, all the gauge elements will be rendered in mirror effect. 
* **Animation** - Animate the gauge elements in a visually appealing way. Animate the gauge elements when they are loading, or when their values change.
* **Interaction** - The shape and widget marker pointers in a Linear Gauge can be moved from one value to another with swipe or drag gestures.
